# Linguistic-cognitive-game

This game is in spanish.

There are three game modes:

Normal mode:
This game mode consists of writing the most words in one minute, pressing enter for each word you write.
The words will be scored from our bank of approximately 1300 words.
For each correct word, you will be given a point if it is misspelled or is not in our word bank.
You will not be given a point.

Quantity mode:
This game mode consists of writing the most words in one minute with the number of letters that will be provided to you, for example: 4 (hola), 5 (adios). For each word with the correct number of letters and that is in our word bank, you will be given a point, otherwise you will not receive any points.

Initial mode:
This game mode consists of giving you a random letter and you must write the most words in one minute that begin with the letter provided, for example: “n” (swim, number, nine); For each correct word (that starts with the given letter) that is in our word bank, you will be awarded one point; otherwise, you will not receive any points.

Remember to write the words in lowercase and without accents, do not write signs, and if the word has an 'ñ' replace it
with an 'n'.
